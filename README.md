# Epoxy
The Epoxy Programming Language

# What is Epoxy?
Epoxy is a interpreted conglomerate programming language written in javascript that has a similar syntax design to lua; it has very simplistic syntax, and was designed to take a step away from c-style languages.

Epoxy is the first language created by FIREYAUTO to have a fully sandboxed environment from its parent language due to the nature of how the closures in the language work.

Epoxy is considerably slow in the grand scheme of a programming language, but this is mainly because of the abstraction to make Epoxy easy to develop. In the future there may be tests to design compilers which could enhance the performance of Epoxy.
